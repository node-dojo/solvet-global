# SOLVET System - Cursor Rules

This file helps Claude understand how to work with the SOLVET system.

## System Overview

SOLVET is a multi-repository system for managing digital products:
- `no3d-tools-library/` - Product assets (private repo)
- `no3d-tools-website/` - Public website (public repo)
- `solvet-system/` - Shared schemas and templates
- `no3d-tools-addon/` - Blender add-on

## Command Patterns

When users ask to manage products, use these patterns:

### Product Management
- "List products" → Scan `no3d-tools-library/Dojo*/` folders, show file status
- "Create product [name]" → Create folder, JSON template, show next steps
- "Validate [product]" → Check for .blend, .json, icon files
- "Update [product] price" → Edit JSON metadata file

### Repository Management
- "Check repo status" → Run `status-all.sh` or check git status
- "Update repos" → Run `update-all.sh` or git pull
- "Commit [repo]" → Stage, commit with message
- "Push [repo]" → Push to remote

### Sync Operations
- "Sync to Polar" → Trigger GitHub Actions or run sync script
- "Sync to website" → Trigger image sync workflow
- "Sync all" → Trigger both workflows

### Validation
- "Validate all" → Check all products for required files
- "Check metadata" → Validate JSON files against schema

## File Locations

- Products: `no3d-tools-library/Dojo*/`
- Website: `no3d-tools-website/`
- Scripts: `scripts/` and `no3d-tools-library/scripts/`
- Templates: `solvet-system/templates/`
- Schemas: `solvet-system/schemas/`

## Workflow Rules

1. Always validate before syncing
2. Check git status before committing
3. Use existing scripts when available
4. Show what will change before destructive operations
5. Provide clear next steps after operations

## Natural Language Commands

Users can ask in natural language. Interpret and execute:
- "Show me all products" → List products
- "Create a new product called X" → Create product workflow
- "What's the status?" → Check repos and products
- "Sync everything" → Full sync workflow

## Slash Commands

Users can also use slash commands for quick actions:
- `/products` → List all products
- `/product create <name>` → Create new product
- `/status` → System status overview
- `/sync all` → Sync to Polar and website
- `/validate` → Validate all products
- `/repo status` → Check repository status

See SLASH_COMMANDS.md for complete slash command reference.
See CURSOR_COMMANDS.md for natural language command reference.
