# SOLVET CLI (Deprecated)

⚠️ **This CLI has been replaced with Cursor/Claude natural language commands.**

See **[CURSOR_COMMANDS.md](../CURSOR_COMMANDS.md)** for the new command system.

## Why the Change?

Instead of a terminal CLI, SOLVET now uses natural language commands within Cursor/Claude:
- ✅ More intuitive - just ask Claude what you need
- ✅ Context-aware - Claude sees your files and workspace
- ✅ No installation needed - works immediately
- ✅ Integrated with existing tools and scripts

## Migration

All CLI commands have natural language equivalents:

| Old CLI Command | New Natural Language |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `solve product list` | "List all products" |
| `solve product create <name>` | "Create a new product called [name]" |
| `solve repo status` | "Check repository status" |
| `solve validate all` | "Validate all products" |
| `solve sync all` | "Sync everything to Polar and website" |

See [CURSOR_COMMANDS.md](../CURSOR_COMMANDS.md) for complete reference.
