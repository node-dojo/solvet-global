# Archive

This directory contains archived files that are no longer actively used but are kept for reference.

## Structure

### `deprecated/`
Deprecated code that has been replaced but kept for historical reference.

### `old-docs/`
Outdated documentation that may contain useful historical context.

### `test-files/`
Old test files that are no longer needed but kept for reference.

## Purpose

Files are archived rather than deleted to:
- Preserve historical context
- Allow reference to old implementations
- Maintain project history
- Enable rollback if needed

## When to Archive

Archive files when:
- They've been replaced by newer versions
- They're no longer actively maintained
- They contain useful historical information
- They may be needed for reference

## Cleanup

Archived files may be permanently deleted:
- After 1 year of being archived
- If they contain security vulnerabilities
- If they're no longer relevant
- With team approval

## Questions?

Contact maintainers if you need to access archived files or have questions about archiving.
